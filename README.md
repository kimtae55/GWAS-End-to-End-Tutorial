# GWAS-End-to-End-Tutorial
This is a Step by Step Tutorial for GWAS (for Plink format), explaining what SNP data looks like, how to perform quality control and imputation procedures, and how to run GWAS.
Figures and explanations here are mostly based on in-depth tutorials: [GWASTutorial](https://cloufield.github.io/GWASTutorial) or [doi: 10.1002/mpr.1608](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6001694/).
