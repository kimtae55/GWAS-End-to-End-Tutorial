# GWAS-End-to-End-Tutorial
This is a Step by Step Tutorial for GWAS, explaining what SNP data looks like, how to perform quality control and imputation procedures, and how to run GWAS.
Check out more detailed tutorials [here](https://cloufield.github.io/GWASTutorial) or [here](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6001694/). 

I aggregate all components of GWAS into one repository, to clear the confusion of what to download and when/how to run certain scripts.
